LIST OF SUBDIRECTORIES IN THIS DIRECTORY:
(no subdirectories)

LIST OF FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY:
- README: (is this file)

- Makefile: contains commands that build the tests of the cellular automata class, and its functionalities by running simulations with different parameters
- disease_simulation.cpp: models disease spreading in a population 
    with custom initialization function based on probability, and a custom rule function to model disease behavior in certain population densities 
- forest.cpp: models the evolution of a plant with a custom intialization   function that factors in fertility probability and a custom rule function to model plant growth (based on crowdedness)
- general_sim.cpp: interactive simulation that takes in user input to run a simulation
