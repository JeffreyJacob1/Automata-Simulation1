This subdirectory contain C++ implementations of our 
Cellular Automata class to hold cell states, neighborhood types, boundary types,
and stepping through the simulation based on those rules which consider those 
different parameters. 



LIST OF FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY:
- README: (is this file)
- Makefile: creates a library from the source files 
- source_automata_class.cpp: C++ implementation of the cellular automata class adn its functions to run the simulation 
- rules.cpp: C++ implementations of the 3 required rule functions: majority, straight, and neihgbor conditional 
- run_sim.cpp: functionality for running a simulation given CA parameters
