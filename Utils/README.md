## USAGE
Directory contains the tools to visualize the results of the cellular automata simulation. Run the following command after you have completed a simulation to see a gif of the grid through the simulation: 

    python visualize_automata.py input_dir -o output_dir --automata_name your_automata
    -h for instructions 

The jupyter notebook contains an example of viewing a grid at a certain time step. This is useful for analysis.
